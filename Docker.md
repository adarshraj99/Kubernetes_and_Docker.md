A Virtualization Platform where multiple copies of the development build images are uploaded to avoid any build failure and to avoid automation code failure in case if dev build failure. 
In case of server hosted apps if we want to run api and UI automation codes and sever is down or any url not working or because of any UI bug all automation can get stuck. So, use docker to have multiple image files of same build. 

- Docker containers: For creating different isolated O.S. environment.
